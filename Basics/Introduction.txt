About C++

C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) 
and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. 

Key Points
Object-Oriented Programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming language,
which means that it allows you to define classes and objects to model real-world entities and their behavior.
Strong Type System: C++ has a strong type system,
which means that variables have a specific type and that type must be respected in all operations performed on that variable.
Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, 
which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.
Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a large set of pre-written algorithms and 
data structures that can be used to simplify your code and make it more efficient.
Cross-platform Compatibility: C++ can be compiled and run on multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a 
versatile language for developing cross-platform applications.
Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that code is transformed into machine code before it is executed. 
This can result in faster execution times and improved performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.
Memory Management: C++ requires manual memory management, which can lead to errors if not done correctly. 
However, this also provides more control over the programâ€™s memory usage and can result in more efficient memory usage.
Syntax: C++ has a complex syntax that can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners. However, with practice and experience, 
it becomes easier to understand and work with.
